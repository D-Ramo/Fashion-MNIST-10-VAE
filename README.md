# Fashion-MNIST-10-VAE
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate images of clothing items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The notebook uses pyTorch to build and train the VAE model.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing items, each of which is 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

# Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that can be used to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new samples from that distribution. In this notebook, we train a VAE on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to generate new images of clothing items.

# Results
After training the VAE model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the notebook generates new images of clothing items using the learned distribution. The generated images are visually similar to the real images in the dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the VAE in generating new samples.
